# SDL_Game
2D top down game created using C++ and libSDL2
After I published my Unity game, I grew more interested in the inner workings of game engines so I decided to try making one.
Some of the code from this project was inspired by this youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQzAHcojEKg&list=PLhfAbcv9cehhkG7ZQK0nfIGJC_C-wSLrx&ab_channel=Let%27sMakeGames

# What I learned
* refined some OOP concepts
* Low level techniques used in game development

# How to run
You may have noticed that I included the entire SDL2 library in this repository to make it easier
* make trancengine
* ./play
